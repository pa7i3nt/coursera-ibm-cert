Frontend: Amazon S3

Amazon S3, or Simple Storage Service, is the cloud equivalent of your virtual hard drive. It’s a scalable object storage service that can store and retrieve any amount of data. When used for web hosting, it becomes the repository for all your static content, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and media files.

-----------------------------------------------

Backend: AWS Lambda and API Gateway

Your website’s backend logic, typically handled by a web server, can be replaced with serverless computing. AWS Lambda allows you to run code without provisioning or managing servers. It’s event-driven, responding to actions like user requests through API Gateway. This means that you pay only for the compute time you consume, and it scales automatically with the traffic your website receives.
-----------------------------------------------

Database: Amazon RDS

One of the critical elements of your web application is the database. Amazon RDS, or Relational Database Service, takes care of this component. It’s fully managed, and you can choose from different database engines like MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, and more. RDS handles routine database tasks like provisioning, patching, backup, recovery, and scaling, allowing you to focus on your application.

For more security the RDS is in the private subnet as it doesn’t require to be open for the internet, by following best security practices it is inside the private subnet.

AWS Services for Data Analytics:

At the heart of this architecture is Amazon EMR, or Elastic MapReduce. EMR is a cloud-native big data platform that processes vast amounts of data quickly and efficiently. It runs Apache Hadoop and Spark, making it a powerful tool for processing and analyzing large datasets. EMR uses a cluster-based approach, where nodes work in parallel to divide the workload, significantly improving processing speed.

-----------------------------------------------

Data Ingestion:

The journey begins with data ingestion. If you have data on-premises, AWS Direct Connect provides a dedicated network connection to AWS. It’s a secure and reliable way to transfer data to the cloud, ensuring that your data remains protected during transit.

-----------------------------------------------

EMR Cluster:

Once the data is in AWS, it’s ingested into your EMR cluster. This cluster resides within an Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC), ensuring the highest level of security and isolation. You have full control over the cluster’s size and configuration, allowing you to scale to meet your data processing needs. EMR’s Hadoop capabilities come to the fore as it processes data, applying transformations and computations at lightning speed.

-----------------------------------------------

Data Storage:

As your data undergoes processing, it’s stored in Amazon S3, Simple Storage Service. S3 is designed for durability and scalability, ensuring that your data remains safe and accessible. What’s more, S3 offers an Intelligent-Tiering feature, which automatically moves data between access tiers based on usage patterns. This not only ensures that your data is available when needed but also optimizes storage costs.

-----------------------------------------------

Data Visualization:

Data without visualization is like a treasure trove without a map. That’s where Amazon QuickSight comes in. QuickSight is a fully managed business intelligence and data visualization service that empowers you to turn your data into insights. It connects to various data sources, including S3, to create interactive dashboards and visualizations.

-----------------------------------------------

This architecture offers several advantages:

Efficiency: EMR’s parallel processing capabilities ensure that your data analytics tasks are completed quickly, even with massive datasets.

Security: AWS Direct Connect and private subnets provide a secure environment for data transfer and processing, and S3 offers data durability and security.

Scalability: You have full control over the size and configuration of your EMR cluster, allowing you to scale resources up or down as needed.

Cost Optimization: By using S3 Intelligent-Tiering, you ensure that you’re not overpaying for storage. Your data is automatically moved to the most cost-effective storage class.
