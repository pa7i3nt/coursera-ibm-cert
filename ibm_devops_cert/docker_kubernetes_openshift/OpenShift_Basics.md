</tr> 

<tr> 
<td width="30%"><b>A/B testing</b></td> 
<td width="70%">Strategy is mostly used for testing new features in front-end applications. It is used to evaluate two versions of the application namely A and B, to assess which one performs better in a controlled environment. The two versions of the applications differ in terms of features and cater to different sets of users. Based on the interaction and responses received from the users such as feedback, you can choose one of the versions of the application that can be deployed globally into production. 
</tr> 

<tr> 
<td width="30%"><b>Build</b></td> 
<td width="70%">The process of transforming inputs into a resultant object. 
</tr>

<tr> 
<td width="30%"valign="top"><b>BuildConfig</b></td> 
<td width="70%">An OpenShift-specific object that defines the process for a build to follow. The build process makes use of the input sources and the build strategy. The BuildConfig is the blueprint, and the build is an instance of that blueprint.
</td> 
</tr> 

<tr> 
<td width="30%"valign="top"><b>Canary Deployments</b></td> 
<td width="70%">Aims to deploy the new version of the application by gradually increasing the number of users. The canary deployment strategy uses the real users to test the new version of the application. As a result, bugs and issues can be detected and fixed before the new version of the application is deployed globally for all the users.

<td width="30%"valign="top"><b>Circuit breaking</b></td> 
<td width="70%">A method to prevent errors in one microservice from cascading to other microservices.
</td>

</td> 
</tr> 

<tr> 
<td width="30%"valign="top"><b>Data plane</b></td> 
<td width="70%">Communication between services is handled by the data plane. If a service mesh is absent, the network cannot identify the type of traffic that flows, the source, and the destination and make any necessary decisions.
</td> 
</tr> 

<tr> 
<td width="30%"valign="top"><b>Enforceability (Control)</b></td> 
<td width="70%"> Istio provides control by enforcing policies across an entire fleet and ensures resources are fairly distributed among consumers.
</td> 
</tr> 

<tr> 
<td width="30%"valign="top"><b>Envoy proxy</b></td> 
<td width="70%">All network traffic is subject to or intercepted by a proxy, called Envoy, used by the service mesh and allows many features depending on the configuration.
</td>

<td width="70%"> A trigger to rebuild a containerized application when a new or updated version of an image is available. For example, if an application is built using a Node.js base image, that image will be updated as security fixes are released and other updates occur.   
</td> </tr>

<tr> 
<td width="30%"valign="top"><b>ImageStream</b></td> 
<td width="70%"> An abstraction for referencing container images within OpenShift. Each image contains an ID, or digest, that identifies it. ImageStreams do not contain image data but rather are pointers to image digests.  </td> </tr>

<td width="70%">A platform-independent and popular service mesh platform, often used with Kubernetes. It intelligently controls the flow of traffic and API calls between services, conducts a range of tests and reduces the complexity of managing network services. Istio secures services through authentication, authorization, and encryption. Istio provides control by defining policies that can be enforced across an entire fleet. With Istio, you can observe traffic flow in your mesh so you can trace call flows, dependencies, and you can view service communication metrics such as latency, traffic, errors and saturation. 
</td> </tr> 

<tr> 
<td width="30%"valign="top"><b>Man-in-the-middle attacks</b></td> 
<td width="70%">A man-in-the-middle (MiTM) attack is a type of cyber-attack where the attacker secretly intercepts and relays messages between two parties who believe they are communicating directly with each other. The attack is a type of eavesdropping in which the attacker intercepts and then controls the entire conversation. </td> </tr>

<td width="70%"> Determines the primary input like a Git repository, an inline Dockerfile, or binary payloads. </td> </tr> 

<tr> <td width="30%" valign="top"><b>Webhook</b></td> 
<td width="70%"> A trigger that sends a request to an OpenShift Container Platform API endpoint. Often this will be a GitHub webhook, though it can also be a generic webhook. If a GitHub webhook is utilized, GitHub can send the request to OpenShift when there is a new commit on a certain branch, or a pull request is merged, or under many more circumstances. Webhooks are a great way to automate development flows so that builds can occur automatically as new code is developed.
